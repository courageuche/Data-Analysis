My Data analysis Project on 2023 Presidential Election result as held in Etche LGA

Top Players
The top players in the just concluded 2023 Presidential election as seen on the result dashboard are the All Progressive Congress (APC), the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP). 
 
Analysis
From the chart above and below it is clear that the Labour Party (LP) pulled 53% of the total valid votes (5,881 votes), the All Progressive Congress (APC) came second with 2,722 votes, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) came third with 2,048 votes and the rest parties shared 5% of the total valid votes which is some worth negligible. Hence, INEC might have to look into measures that could be used to reduce the number other parties that participates in the election. 
 
Furthermore, As shown on the chart below, it is quite interesting that Ward 3 has 50% of the total registered voters in the Local Government Area and consequently had a higher percentage of the total valid votes. From the top left column chart on the dash board, it is from this ward that LP pulled their bulk vote and consequently won the election. Hence, the other parties should focus more of their attention on this ward if they want to get a better result from this LGA.
 
However, the number of accredited voters is just 24% (i.e. 12,104) of the Registered voters (50,920) as seen from the chart below.
 
This is very poor and could have been as a result of voter apathy or disenfranchisement. The voter disenfranchisement was mainly caused by late arrival of most INEC officials, as it was noticed in most of the polling units that the INEC officials arrived very late thereby reducing the time allocated for the voting process consequently, depriving a large number of electorates of their right to vote. While the voter apathy could have been as a result of fear of insecurity or mobility difficulty due the distance of the polling from the electorates.
From the chart below, it can be seen that the number of accredited voters that did not vote was less than the difference in vote between LP (leaders) and APC (runner-up), thus the outcome of the election considering voter disenfranchisement is not in doubt. 
 
Nonetheless, One of the major positives noticed in the just concluded Presidential election in Etche LGA is the level of voters’ education and enlightenment in terms of the voting process and this is evident in the fact that 91.3% of the accredited votes (11,050 votes) were valid after the vote cast.
